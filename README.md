In the first phase, we are just trying to create an environment to facilitate the simulation of both the protocols and help in the setup, assesment and manipulation of the underlying network setups in each case.

1. Setting up Mininet (**Ubuntu**)

```
	run bash mininet_setup.sh
```

**Note:** Just DON'T Do it

2. Use The mininet VM
